.Sh NAME
.Nm zz80asm
.Nd z80 cross assembler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm zz80asm
.Op Fl b Ar length
.Op Fl f Ar b|h|m
.Op Fl l Op Ar listfile
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl s Ar a|n
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl x
.Ar filename ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility assembles the files
.Ar filename ...
and writes to the output file
.Ar outfile ,
and optionally the listing file
.Ar listfile .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar length
Set
.Ar length
bytes per record in Intel Hex formatted
.Ar outfile .
By default,
.Ar length
is interpreted as a decimal number.
With a leading
.Cm 0x
or
.Cm 0X ,
.Ar length
is interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
otherwise, with a leading
.Cm 0 ,
.Ar length
is interpreted as an octal number.
The default length is 16 decimal.
.It Fl f Ar b|h|m
Format
.Ar outfile
as either binary, Intex Hex, or binary with Mostek header, respectively.
Intel Hex is the default format.
.It Fl l Op Ar listfile
Generate listing file as
.Ar listfile ,
or as
.Ar filename.lst
by default.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Set output filename to
.Ar outfile
instead of the default
.Ar filename.hex
or
.Ar filename.bin .
.It Fl s Ar a|n
Generate symbol table at end of listing file.
This option only works in combination with
.Ar -l .
.Ar a
and
.Ar n
sort the symbol table by address or name, respectively.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.It Fl x
Do not output data into
.Ar outfile
for DEFS in pass two of the assembler.
